Our mission is to make your life easier so one of the main ideas behind our philosophy is PRACTICALITY. We also care deeply for our Planet and wish that everybody would lead a more minimal life and therefore use less clothes /#CONSUMEWISELY/.
</p>

 <p>
 That is why the quality of our products is the highest possible. You can use them for years and pass them on when you are done. We use top fabrics with both GOTS Organic Cotton Certificate & STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX®. All of our products can be frequently machine washed & tumbled dried. You will discover that our cotton fleece does not even require ironing to look good. Our shoes have a detached inner sole so you can wash either just the sole or the whole shoe.
